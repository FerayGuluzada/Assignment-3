run the database

from where you are:

2) cd Assignment-3

3) cd src

4) json-server --watch db.json

this will open db.json at local:3000


run the react app

from where you are:

1) cd assignment-react

2) cd Assignment-3

3) npm start

press anything on the navbar (Home, Flashcards, Contact), or the page will appear empty 

since local:3000 is occupied with the database it will ask if you want to run it on a different port,
say yes


this should help you successfully run the project
